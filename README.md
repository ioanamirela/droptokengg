# Drop Token GG

## Overview

Drop Token takes place on a 4x4 grid. A token is dropped along a column (labeled 0‚Äê3) and said token goes to the 
lowest unoccupied row of the board. 

A player wins when they have 4 tokens next to each other either along a row, in a column, or on a
diagonal. 

If the board is filled, and nobody has won then the game is a draw. 

Each player takes a turn, starting with player 1, until the game reaches either win or draw. 

If a player tries to put a token in a column that is already full, that results in an error state, and the player must play again until they play a valid move.

## Game mechanics

The player is going up against none other than BB-8 and has the option to go first or let BB-8 make the first move:

Once this choice has been made, the game is on! The player and BB-8 drop tokens until one of them wins or there is a draw.


If a player tries to put a token in a column that is already full, the player is notified that they need to play again.

## Algorithm

1. We will initialize an N x N board with zero values. In this case N = 4.
   
2. When player1 makes a move we will populate the corresponding [row,cell] with the value 1.
   When player 2 makes a move we will use the board size + 1 (in this case 4+1 = 5).
   
   Every time a player makes a move, the corresponding row, column sum arrays and diagonal sums will be adjusted accordingly, by adding 1 if player1 moved or 5 if player2 moved.
   We want to keep these numbers far apart from each other to make it easier to determine a win without having to iterate through the board matrix every time, thus reducing our time complexity from O(N^2) to O(N).
   
   Player 1 wins if the sum of any column, row or diagonal reaches N (4 in our case).
   
   Player 2 wins if the sum of any column, row or diagonal reaches N * (N + 1) (20 in our case).
   
3. Since we have an NxN board, the maximum number of moves we can have in a game is N^2 (for a 4x4 board it would be 16).  
   A draw is reached when the moves array length is equal to N^2.


## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test` or `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
